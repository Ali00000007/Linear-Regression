# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression From Scratch

This project demonstrates how to implement Simple Linear Regression from scratch using Gradient Descent in Python, without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn. It leverages Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for visualization. The goal is to predict salary based on years of experience using a simple linear model.

Gradient Descent Algorithm
Loss Function
The loss function used here is the mean squared error (MSE)

Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is used to minimize the error by adjusting m and b.

Visualizations
After running the script, a plot will appear that shows:

The scatter plot of actual data points (YearsExperience vs. Salary).
A red line representing the predicted linear relationship between YearsExperience and Salary after gradient descent optimization.
